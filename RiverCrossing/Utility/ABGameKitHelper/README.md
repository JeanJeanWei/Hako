Getting ABGameKitHelper up and running is fairly easy, here a step by step guide to get you started:

1. Add "GameKit.framework" Library to your Project

2. In ABGameKitHelper.m edit APPNAME and AESKEY to your liking

3. In your AppDelegate's ..application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions… Method add following code to automatially authenticate player with GameCenter: 

	<code>[[ABGameKitHelper sharedClass] authenticatePlayer];</code>


3. Thats the basic setup, easy huh? Now on to actually interacting with GameCenter:

<strong>Show Leaderboard</strong>

<code>[[ABGameKitHelper sharedClass] showLeaderboard:@"leaderboardID"];</code>

<strong>Show Achievements</strong>

<code>[[ABGameKitHelper sharedClass] showAchievements];</code>

<strong>Report Achievement</strong>

<code>[[ABGameKitHelper sharedClass] reportAchievement:@"achievementID" percentComplete:100];</code>

<strong>Show Notification</strong> (Is only once per completed Achievement)

<code>[[ABGameKitHelper sharedClass] showNotification:@"Notification Title" message:@"Some Message" identifier:@"achievementID"];</code>

<strong>Report Leaderboard Score</strong>

<code>
[[ABGameKitHelper sharedClass] reportScore:2000 forLeaderboard:@"leaderboardID"];
</code>

<strong>!</strong>
If no Internet connection is present during reporting Achievemnts/Leaderboard Scores are automatically cached and reported the next time the Player authenticates (The Code in the AppDelegate)
